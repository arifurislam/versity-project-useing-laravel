Notre Dame College is seeing as a family. All the students, teaching and non-teaching staff and administrative staff are the members of Notre Dame Family. Notre Dame Family life is based on mutual respect, love, sharing of responsibility and common interest for the integral formation of the students. Here every one performs duty with sincerity, competency, and compassionately which bring a unique dimension to the Notre Dame Family. The glory of Notre Dames does not lie on its glorious board exam result only, but also in the opportunity it offers for the poor, under privileged and tribal students coming from different parts of the country.
